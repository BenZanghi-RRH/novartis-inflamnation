So I have last been in 2021 under the old DAS program, but it is essentially the same principle I have Lupus and Fibro and the priority pass was honestly an absolute god sent. It was legitimately the first time in my life that my disabilities felt like something \"good\". You might still have to wait, but at least there are sometimes benches in the disability waiting areas and the wait will be significantly shorter. I do not know if I got any angry looks, certainly a few confussed ones when trying to enter a ride through the exit, but seriously nothing bad. And I hate confrontation too. The cast members were all excellent about it. I was so worried before going about whether I would be able to make it through the days but the priority card really did make it a magical trip! While I agree that the system is often being abused (I hope this will change with the new MagicAll program) and qualifications need to be met, to those who say \"being disabled does not mean you get to jump a que!!!?!?\", I would like to say a whole hearted f*ck you. Life is not fair, it certainly is not to us disabled people, and while yes, queing is not exactly fun for most people, for us it is often simply not possible. And why should not we for once be the ones to get a little pixie dust? Three more things that might be interesting: 1. I had a collapsible cane with me that I was worried about, but had absolutely zero problems bringing into the parks. 2. Some rides lose some of the magic (for me at least) when using the disabled que. In Phantom Manor for example you miss out on the stretching room (or at least we did during covid, it is possible that had to do with distancing guidelines or something) 3. If you travel to or through Paris, be prepared: Paris is possibly the most unaccessible city I have ever been to, especially if you need the metro. STAIRS. EVERYWHERE. Hope you have a great trip!

I am a teacher and I have had some kids even make fun of me for it. I also have it pretty on my genitals. My penis and scrotum are constantly enflamed and flaking. Sometimes it really hurts and it is itchy and prevents me from being able to be sexually intimate without pain or bleeding when the skin cracks. I have heard that biologics can do wonders for people, but I am scared to do it because I have heard somewhere that people with psoriasis have a slightly increased chance of developing lymphomas. I was not sure if this is from the psoriasis itself or the treatments because they are directly affecting the immune system, but both my father and grandmother died from lymphoma so I am scared to start any kind of biologic treatment if there is a risk. I wish I had not read some of these articles because I have no idea if they have any scientific or medical evidence to back them up, but the fear is there now. If anyone could offer their insight, I would be so thankful.

Did your laundry detergent change and your skin flared? Did you start using a different soap? Most people with psoriasis have lots of environmental triggers and if you find what those are, you can do a LOT to mitigate at least some of your suffering.

Definitely get more tests, but the rheumatologist is probably correct at this time. Diagnoses can morph and change over time. Also autoimmune diseases tend to travel with *friends* and many of us live with multiple autoimmune diseases and syndromes. Sometimes we get lucky and treatments give us periods of remission though, so there is hope. I may be misinterpreting, but it seems like you feel like the Hashi's diagnosis is less serious of a situation than the lupus diagnosis. Hashi's is as serious and significant as lupus. And lupus is as serious as Hashi's. Both are the result of a runaway immune system. However with Hashi's there is no real immunotherapy (yet), they just give us thyroid hormones to cope with the consequences of our immune system eating our thyroid.

They also have a rescue balm soap that I use during flares one of the few cleansers that does not burn when I use it on my face. ( I have found that by applying the oils and balm at the earliest sign of a flare up, and reapplying consistently once they have soaked into my skin, there is not nearly as much swelling, rash, itching, burning, peeling and cracking as there is when I use the prescription ointment.

I got diagnosed with lupus in September last year while going through a severe flare from the beginning of July. Due to the flare and lupus developing I ended up weighing the lowest ever which was 125 pounds. I was so ill I could barely eat due to the flare up. When my rheumatologist diagnosed me she gave me the medications needed and started me at 60mg of prednisone and since then we lowered it bit by bit. Due to the prednisone increasing my appetite I ended up gaining about 40 pounds. Last check up my rheumatologist told me I needed to fix my diet(ant 5mg of prednisone at this point) and make sure to be active at least 30 minutes a day. I started February 2nd by doing walks that ranged between 1-2miles each day and everyday I have done beginner ab workouts(15 knee tucks, 15 toe touches, 15 Russian twist, 15 suitcase crunches, 15 leg lifts) I cut down sugar and breads almost completely and have been having about two meals and snacks such as fruits each day. I lost almost seven pounds now and am just wondering if that sounds reasonable with what I have been doing for the past 20 days. I am also a bit scared that once I get off prednisone my appetite will be once again bad like how it was in the flare. I honestly think I am just scared of possibly experiencing that trauma again.

X-rays can show effusions (though they can miss small ones), and also, it could rule out something like lung infiltrates from things such a pneumonia. Other possibilities, depending on symptoms, are inflammation in your chest, either in the muscles and/or cartilage of your ribs/breastbone. Causing intermittent or consistent sharp pains with breathing in and out or certain movements. It can happen with flares and coincide with an increase in fatigue. Though it does not cause shortness of breath, it may feel that way due to limiting deep breathing due to pain.","disease":"pericarditis","classification":"Heart Disease"}]},

I also took Lamictal and quetiapine (fairly short-term on this one). I weaned off of all medications nearly 5 years ago and was doing very well until postpartum.

I saw a cardiologist who assured me that my heart is structurally fine, but my PCP thinks I may need a pacemaker as I get older. I have a cardiology appointment within the next few weeks as a check-up since it is been a few years. My PCP was hesitant to prescribe sertraline given my LBBB, and I know that some SSRIs may prolong your QT interval. My understanding is that my QT is falsely prolonged due to the LBBB, so I am honestly not sure what it actually is because I have zero expertise. I had a 2-week Holter test several months ago and it showed the following: QT min: 371 ms QT avg: 414 ms QT max: 485 ms QTcB min: 444 ms QTcB avg: 482 ms QTcB max: 510 ms QTcB > 460 ms: 65.17% Given the possible side effect of QT prolongation with sertraline, is it safe to use at a low dose? My PCP now thinks it is safe, but she was hesitant before, so I do not feel very trusting right now. I understand that these side effects are rare, but I figured it is rare to have LBBB at my age, too! I am just really struggling and can no longer drive due to anxiety.

This is a problem because double bonds make the fatty acid extremely susceptible to lipid peroxidation, which can lead to formation of toxic aldehydes like 4-HNE. It has been implicated in many problems like cancer, heart failure, and inflammatory problems. In Alzheimer's, levels of 4-HNE are elevated in the brain and plasma of the patients. 4-HNE increases your cell's sensitivity to benzopyrene diol epoxide, a mutagen, cytotoxin, and carcinogen found in sources of air pollution including the burning of wood and fossil fuels. Another aldehyde formed is malondialdehyde(MDA). This mutagen is also another carcinogen from oxidation of these PUFAs. 4-HNE also damages the P53 gene, which helps fight against cancer in your body. Mutations in this gene are associated with a number of cancers. Also, RBD oils treated with solvents like hexane, a known neurotoxin. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are omega 6's, which promote inflammation, and are often over consumed because of seed oils in diet.

I have been to Arizona a few times too, and I was fascinated that I felt cooler even in 100\u00b0F+ weather because my sweat actually worked. A breeze was actually a godsend, not just blowing more hot air on me. Not so when I was in Miami, FL in May. I stepped outside and felt the same dread as I do in Texas, so it was not just the effect of being on a vacation cancelling out my symptoms. it is the heat and humidity. My symptoms are also much less in the late fall-early spring. But here, I would say summer lasts 6 months. April-September. I cannot afford to move west, so I am planning to move to the Northeast. Half of my motivation to do so is the weather. It seems to get more intolerable every year that I am still in Texas. I pay more electricity to keep my home 76\u00b0F instead of 78\u00b0F. I got a portable a/c for my room to get it really cool when I am flaring up. These adjustments barely take the edge off. it is like, my body knows when it is over 85\u00b0F outside. I swell up, my joints hurt, my skin gets rough. The heat seems to radiate from inside though. Sometimes taking some Tylenol helps, but a thermometer does not register a fever. If I have ever had access to a pool, that momentarily helps. Taking a cold shower is not really a thing in a place that does not get below 80\u00b0F at night. The water that comes out of the cold tap here is also warm. it is so hard to find a way to actually cool down enough that I am comfortable.","disease":"Heat intolerance or related symptoms due to anemia","classification":"Other"}]},

It focuses on the gut microbiome and how to heal your gut using different supplements, eliminating known inflammatory foods, detoxification from toxins like heavy metals and how to combat/prevent infections. It is eye opening but very shocking. It has allowed me to understand how autoimmunity develops and why some are susceptible to autoimmunity. It has alleviated some of the guilt I have held for not seeking a diagnosis sooner. It is not just genetics. As our environment becomes more and more toxic, autoimmunity is increasing. We have the ability to control our symptoms while others seek to cure it. This book gives you a new avenue to explore. I am someone who will try anything except more pharmaceuticals medication. Working through these steps, I was able to return to work part-time last week. I feel better everyday.

One thing that my G.I. doctor never told me, but I learned from my own research including reading this thread, is that ulcerative colitis is an autoimmune disease, like multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and so many more. Unfortunately, autoimmune diseases can only be managed with medications, often more than one. My symptoms were so bad before I was diagnosed and went on medication that there was a few days where I thought I was going to die. But medicine, especially prednisone, saved me. I tried changing my diet multiple times but it did not help. you are right, no one is meant to live through medications, but our bodies sometimes have different ideas. Because of having multiple health problems, I am currently on seven different prescriptions and two vitamin supplements. If I want to have any quality of life or length of life, I HAVE to be on each one of those. (I may be able to drop one of the prescriptions in a few years, but the others are life-long.) Going without any of them would make my life miserable, and perhaps even put my life in danger. I hate being on all these meds but I am so grateful for them. If it were 75-100 years ago, I probably would have died a few years ago. And taking these meds allow me to have a fairly normal life. I have even read how some people with UC go into remission far enough they are able to run marathons.

I wanted to introduce myself and share a bit of my chronic kidney disease journey. I was diagnosed with lupus nephritis at 14, and although my high school years were fine, things took a turn during my sophomore year of college when my kidneys began to fail. Over the years, I tried multiple treatments-medications, shots, chemotherapy-but nothing seemed to help. By 2014, I was in acute renal failure and spent years going on and off dialysis. By 2016, I was dealing with severe symptoms: extreme fatigue, weight gain from edema, vision loss, and high blood pressure. My condition worsened to the point where I needed dialysis indefinitely. I was placed on the transplant list that year, but despite a large family, no one stepped forward to donate, which led me into a deep depression. In 2019, I switched to home hemodialysis, and although it was a commitment (four sessions a week), it allowed me to feel healthier and enjoy more time with family, even traveling to Hawaii and on my boyfriend's work trips. After over seven years, I finally received a kidney transplant in 2023. The surgery went perfectly, and I was out of the hospital in four days! The relief of no longer being on a renal diet and being able to use the bathroom again was indescribable. My family and I are so grateful for my donor. Since then, I have had an incredible year-celebrating my first transplant anniversary in September 2024, getting engaged at Mount Fuji in Japan, completing my data analytics certification, finishing an internship, and planning for a wedding and a future baby! it is been a transformative year, and I feel healthier and happier than ever.

From what I know, if you do home PD, there is a line inserted in the belly area and has to be hooked up on your own. This helps you on the transplant list because it shows responsibility for your own care from what they told me. it is done everyday ( ? ) for 8 hours so it can be done when you sleep but a lot of people experience drain pain at the end of the session.

Even better, he said it is the only biologic for UC that has not shown increased risk for cancers as a side effect. Further, it does not require the regular blood tests of the other options he might consider. Lastly, the side effects are minimal, pretty much limited to fatigue and seasonal allergy type symptoms. Stelara was his 2nd choice if insurance denied Entyvio, the downside being that it is systemic so it lowers your immune system overall, and prior to starting you have to have a TB test and blood tests for metabolic, CBC and hepatitis because of side effects and there is ongoing testing not required for Entyvio. It shares most side effects with Entyvio adding some possible serious lung issues and increased risk of certain cancers. Maybe other stuff as well but I do not remember.

She is not showing any symptoms but she is currently on Pimobendan and Enalapril to help manage her disease. She also has hyperlipidemia and has a history of some GI issues. After having a consultation with a veterinary dental specialist, I was told that she has 2 back molars showing some gum recession, but otherwise the vet said she is not showing much recession and that it is hard to check for red/inflamed gums because hers are black. However, she does have a ton of tartar build up and the vet mentioned that her breed is notorious for having dental issues so I should expect her condition to be significantly worse than it appears externally. She mentioned I should be prepared for 15+ extractions and that she would likely be under anesthetic for 2-3 hours. During the consultation, the vet mentioned that in the worst case scenario, my dog could go into congestive heart failure while under anesthetic. She said it is not too likely and can often be reversed, but the possibility has me second guessing whether or not I should proceed with the dental. I was just hoping for some insight/advice of how risky this procedure would be for a dog with her type of heart disease, and whether the risk is worth it?

Have an ok stethoscope and do not press too hard or too soft, or on the ribs themselves, but in between them.

As for sounds themselves, there is really not that many of them: ronchi, wheezing, crackles (or rales), stridor, and pleural rub. they are fairly easy to tell apart, just watch the videos on youtube so your ear gets adjusted. Lung sounds are not as hard to master as cardiac murmurs, but everything comes with practice! Pro Tip 1: different diseases like different parts of the lung, so the sounds will be pronounced more somewhere and less somewhere else. In my experience, patients with idiopathic lung fibrosis had extremely audible fine crackles in upper lung lobes, whereas heart failure patients had them in middle, but especially in lower lobes. Get a knack of that. Pro Tip 2: sometimes with advanced lung disease, especially in obstructive disease, inhaling through the nose can barely fill lungs properly with air, so both inspiration and expiration are as good auscultating somebody's foot. This happened a lot of emphysema patients. Those patients you can tell to inhale through the mouth to make the sounds stronger and pronounced. Pro tip 3 and 4: you do not need an expensive piece, any ok stethoscope will do, I have an ADC which is amazing, it can give any Littmann a run for it is money.

Therapy is the key. Problem is society want to make you think that us, grown men's, cannot cry because it is a sign of weakness. The pressure to conform to a stoic and unyielding image of masculinity is ingrained in our culture. Men are often taught to suppress their emotions, to put on a brave face, and to carry the weight of their struggles in silence. This toxic expectation has severe consequences, as it discourages vulnerability and fosters a sense of isolation. The truth is, it takes immense strength to confront and express one's emotions. The idea that seeking help or showing vulnerability makes a person less of a man is not only outdated but harmful. It perpetuates a cycle of suffering in silence, preventing individuals from reaching out for the support they desperately need. In reality, acknowledging and addressing emotional struggles is a courageous act that can lead to healing and growth. Society needs to redefine masculinity, allowing men the freedom to be authentic and emotionally honest without fear of judgment.

I eventually got really depressed that this was something I would have to live with forever, until I remembered the doctors advice to get rid of all chemicals and just take short cool water-only showers. that is what I have been doing for about 10 to 15 years and it is completely solved all my skin and body odor problems.

I did not see you mention getting Schirmer's tests, and that is another piece of data that can be helpful in diagnosing someone whose blood tests are less conclusive. May be a little easier to get someone on board with than a lip biopsy, anyway. Overall, I appreciate your willingness to thoroughly investigate the literature for ways to improve your patients' quality of life. Autoimmune illnesses can be frustrating in how they can start presenting with symptoms well before someone fully meets criteria or starts flagging on tests, particularly Sjogren's. Sometimes the answer ends up being \"wait and see,\" in regards to what the eventual diagnosis is, but I have seen a fair number of rheumatologists in practice who believe there is not much harm in calling a reasonable enough cluster of symptoms/test results \"UCTD\" and treating with hydroxychloroquine only. Research suggests that of those diagnosed with UCTD, 1/3 eventually progress into a clear-cut, diagnosable disease; 1/3 stay the same without the development of additional symptoms; and 1/3 go into remission. Obviously, I am not medically trained, just someone who has done enough of a PhD that I can understand the methods section of medical journal articles, so please defer to the opinions of your colleagues.

I have one piece of advice - try CBD oil (preferably full-spectrum) - it works in a way that it balances your endocannabinoid system which is also \"in charge\" of controlling the immune system response - and with autoimmune diseases, the immune system is overreacting - with use of cannabinoids (CBD, THC, and so on) you can balance your immune system to not overreact. Of course, a quality CBD balm/cream will also help in combination with CBD oil - if you decide to try, start with small doses 2-3 times a day and increase gradually after every few days or weekly. Do not expect overnight results, as it can take up to a month or so to balance your endocannabinoid system (and consequently immune system) before you will start noticing the results.

It was super depressing and frustrating but I am 18 now and have learned to enjoy what I can. I have gotten into swimming which works for me because it is low impact. I still cannot walk super far but I have felt a lot better mentally being able to find a physical activity that I love. It still took a year of being on some really strong immunosuppressants to get here though. Hydrochloroquine by itself might not fix your symptoms though. My rheumatologist considers it more of a supplement for lupus which helps reduce flares. I understand your frustration as well because it is hard to feel disabled when you should still be young enough to be physically able to do the things you love. Even though it is hard to feel hopeful the worst of the symptoms and pain will not last forever. It might take a while to find a treatment plan that works for you but soon enough you will be able to painlessly play with your puppy again. Also I recommend seeing if gentle swimming works for you too. My heart goes out to all of us suffering with this horrible condition.","disease":"lupus","classification":"Other"}]},

The rheumatologist got all the negative tests back and was really unsure if the rash on my face was psoriasis. The last thing they checked was my nails and they were like do you get acrylics? Never. Turns out I had some serious nail pitting that was the turning point in my diagnosis. Im still not convinced I do not have lupus too, and will be addressing with my new doctor next week. After several appointments, they found out that I had pretty severe psoriasis in my ears and from what I have heard, idk why that is not one of the first things they check. I thought I was getting recurring ear infections for so long, I never put two and two together. I also ended up with psoriasis in my eye (I forget what the name for this is) which is another obvious indicator of PsA if your having all the other symptoms I had.

The next hospital I went to (after going septic, again) saved my life. I literally was dead for 3 minutes. They almost called time. After that I fell through the cracks with all the doctors afterwards and was bounced around, getting more and more ill regardless of my efforts. We moved state, and I am finally receiving decent care, although at this point, due to all the traumas and neglect of the medical system, I now have the beginnings of both kidney and heart failure, am in massive amounts of chronic pain, and there is not a whole lot we can do. I am 32. I have a 5 year old son. I may not live to see him be a teenager due to medical neglect. I am not saying EVERY doctor is horrible, but more often than not, my entire family and my husbands family have received subpar and even horrible care. it is even worse for females. I have had doctors not take me seriously unless my oldest brother or my husband have been with me. They usually change their minds and give me better care when they realize I was in their field for about 2 years and know most laws regarding insurance, HIPAA, and most medical terms and jargon. They cannot bs me and once they realize that they usually give me better care.","disease":"chronic illnesses, kidney failure, heart failure","classification":"Heart Disease"}]},

Sure - you have RA, and you have costo. And your RA is a systemic auto-immune inflammation condition. However, costo is not. that is completely clear from one piece of medical research (Disla et al). it is much more likely that separate from having RA, you have also been getting tight and hunched in your thoracic spine and rib cage. This is very common, from much bending over computers and smartphones. It sets off the ongoing strain at the rib joints on your breastbone - a.k.a. costo. This means the costo is more of a straightforward tightness and strain problem of the rib cage, and not a direct consequence of the RA itself. This is a good thing, because it makes the costo - usually - readily fixable. As an example, here's a video by Samantha Wayne, a young woman with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) which is also a rheumatoid auto-immune systemic inflammatory condition, just like RA. She had costo for a year, then treated it herself by freeing up the tight rib joints around the back, and fixed her costo. Years later, she still has the SLE, but is still completely clear of the costo. So her costo was not because of her SLE, and it is likely your costo is not because of your RA either. So it is likely that it is fixable. there is a road map on how to do this in the PDF in my post on treating costo in the **Pinned posts (1)** \"What works for you?\" section at the top of this Reddit sub.

I would encourage you to see an internal medicine/primary care doctor to track symptoms and your generalized 'not feeling well.' All of your journey is not always going to be under your rheumatologist umbrella. I see my rheumatologist every 3 months, we run labs, talk about things, etc, but she does not even manage my 'flares'- I go to urgent care or primary care for that. Now that I am older, I see an orthopedist for joint pain and physical therapy, cardiology for my heart, etc. Dermatology is also another good one - because everything is going to itch and have a bump :). I also worked from home for several years but triggers (with lupus) can be everything from the weather (hot, cold, storms.) to sunlight, to foods, to caffeine, to meds (a couple of my doctors were disagreeing about things which is when I gave up going back and forth between them and got an internal medicine Dr who monitors everything). Since this is all relatively new for you, take a deep breath :) it will come. And Lupus is tricky, just when you think you have figured something out, it will change. it is not you. So be easy on yourself and hang in there. Get more medical support. Even if it is a 24 hour nurse line or someone you can ask questions. Stay rested. Stay hydrated. The first year is the worst.

It brought me so much anxiety around my heart that simply walking from my bedroom to the kitchen and feeling my heart rate get higher,(low 120's), would trigger me to start getting anxious. It was almost like I did not trust my body to be able to handle the blood volume increase. Our bodies are amazing how they adapt, but mentally, I was not adapting. As I got further along, getting out of breath doing normal things like going to the grocery store was triggering, which in turn did not help my breathing. It was a vicious cycle and the pregnancy that I worried the most about. I even had an echo done while pregnant, but still did not bring me the peace of mind I thought it would because being pregnant can make you feel like you have heart issues (at least in my experience) because the shortness of breath, faster heart rate, feeing like you cannot get a good breath in, all are symptoms of something. I do not have too many tips honestly, but just know you are not alone in your feelings. Take it easy and do not be too hard on yourself. Remember that pregnancy is hard on the body, so give yourself grace and try to trust that your body is strong! And if you ever feel like something is wrong or you are uneasy about something, tell your OB. it is hard being pregnant with anxiety because you are limited in your options of how to treat it. Might sound lame, but looking into calming techniques and breathing techniques could be helpful. Anytime my higher heart rate started making me anxious, I would pause what I was doing, try to take a few deeps breaths and call someone I trusted if I was alone to just talk to and tell them what was going on and distract me a bit.","disease":"anxiety related to heart issues during pregnancy","classification":"Heart Disease"}]},

I have often thought that it would not get any better and that there was no way forward, but I have always managed to come through. For me, I have found that exercise and a healthy lifestyle have the greatest impact on the disease. Another important factor is one's mental state. The stronger your mindset and your ability to see things positively even in the darkest times, the better the course of your illness. In difficult situations, I always remind myself that God does not give us more than we can handle. I cannot stress enough how important exercise is. I have always told myself that if I am in top physical shape, I cannot be simultaneously extremely sick. Similarly, someone who is extremely sick cannot be in top physical shape. Therefore, I seize every opportunity to build myself up physically whenever I can. This has helped me get through difficult times with minimal damage. Despite having had strokes, lung bleeding, and heart surgery, Lupus has also helped me let go of many bad habits. I used to take a lot of drugs in my youth and would often drink excessively. Since having Lupus, I have become much more cautious and mindful of my body and health. This has helped me become a better person. I wish everyone here strength, and I can truly understand your pain.

Meaning that your immune system has decided that some natural part of your body does not belong and your immune system essentially tries to get rid of it. This leads to inflammation. All auto immune diseases are the immune system malfunctioning, but they target different parts of the body. Many people who have auto immune disorders are genetically predisposed or inherited the genes that make it more likely from their family. If you are the first person in your family, it is likely you had an ancestor far back when they did not have a name for it who had it, or maybe you are the first person in your family- it has to begin somewhere, might be with you. In fact you do not have to have the same auto immune disorder as other family members, the predisposition to *any* of them is the key. Other auto immune disorders that are common include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, MS, type 1 diabetes, IBS, celiac, and hashimoto's. If anyone in your family has any of those, it is likely you are genetically predisposed. Often times a triggering event causes the disorder to start to present itself, if you have the genes. A triggering event could be a bad illness, a major surgery, an extremely stressful event, etc. I have known 2 different people that began having symptoms of auto immune disorders and were eventually diagnosed after having had a particularly awful time being infected with covid. I have not known anyone to start having symptoms of an auto immune disorder after receiving the vaccine.

For comfort, my CHB baby just had his first pacemaker replaced at 8.5 years old. As far as having another baby, I was TERRIFIED but determined. Like you, I spoke with my rheumatologist to let her know I would like to TTC. I also reached out to Mala, Dr. Buyon's assistant to see if there were any doctors near me (Houston, TX) that were participating in her trial. Monitoring was very intensive! Starting at 16 weeks I had to send 30 second recording of my baby girls heart via Doppler, 3x a day. A cardiologist would listen to each recording and let me know if everything sounded normal. This was a requirement of the clinical trial. I also had the comfort of sending her a recording if I thought things sounded weird. Also at the 16 week mark, I went in for weekly fetal echocardiograms. The intent of the heavy monitoring from 16 to 26 (if I am remembering correctly) weeks is hoping to catching the heart block, if any, at 1st or 2nd degree. If a baby were to progress to 1st or 2nd degree heart block between appts or between Doppler recordings, IVIG would be administered to try and reverse the heart block. In the rheumatic side, I believe I was visiting my rheumatologist every 3 months as opposed to every 6 months when not pregnant.

They did X-rays and blood work and found her to be in heart failure. Her heart was enlarged, in the xray it showed her heart was taking up most of her rib cage at that point. She was still acting calm and well behaved, as if she knew she would be departing soon. Our options were to try to treat her symptoms and hope that she would pull out of it a bit and come through to be more comfortable and have more time- but it wasnt a guarantee that she would get better and even if she did she was still going into heart failure.

THEN on Stelara I got an eczema like reaction on my hands that was forcing me to wear ointment and gloves every night to sleep, and was still so itchy during the day I thought I was going to lose my damn mind! **Then** Rinvoq started going through trials for Crohn's, so my dermatologist switched me to that after consulting with my GI. My acne was SO BAD for about 4-5 months that I was very, very close to quitting. My skin was insanely oily constantly, and I had both huge cystic acne AND giant pus filled white heads. It was horrible and legitimately affecting my self-esteem. However! This is the best that my GI symptoms have ever been, AND my acne is largely cleared. I use CeraVe foaming acne wash in the shower, and Keihl's moisturizer which is kind of pricy, but that about does the trick! I also like that it is a pill, on Stelara I got an injection site reaction that would last for an entire week each time, Remicade was annoying because my infusion place is far away, and I had the only kind of Humira and it *fucking hurt*. My husband is on the new kind for psoriasis and he just does not get it also he can inject in his leg, whereas mine was in my stomach, and somehow that just made it seem worse.","disease":"Crohn's disease","classification":"Other"}]},

I am lucky that the group of practitioners I use has its own rheumatology group so it was easy for her to refer me. First rheum appointment they ordered more bloodwork. Some of it was the same as previous orders just to see if anything changed, as well as checking vitamin levels. She found nail pits which I did not even know I had, and said that was usually the tell-tale sign of PsA but we had press on with NSAIDs and vitamins to see improvement. That was the PA and when we saw no improvement, she said she was willing to treat as PsA moving forward. Once I saw the MD, she confirmed the symptoms of the diagnosis and referred me to a dermatologist just to corroborate the nail pitting as psoriasis. Derm said she concurred. Rheum made the diagnosis official. I was pregnant at the time so my symptoms had basically disappeared, but she went ahead with getting a prior authorization for biologics anyway in case things returned, especially since it tends to get worse postpartum.

But once I finally got my act together and made some changes, I was stoked! My psoriasis went from full-blown to just 10%. For quick relief, try moisturizing the affected area daily with a strong emollient. I am a fan of Epaderm cream, but your pharmacist might have other cool suggestions. In my book, the best way to tackle psoriasis is from the inside out. That means shaking up your diet, tweaking your lifestyle, and figuring out what triggers your flare-ups. Oh, and say sayonara to refined sugar. there is a real connection between diet and psoriasis. Meat, spicy food, nightshades, and processed food were like kryptonite for my psoriasis. Once I gave them the boot, my psoriasis became way more manageable. So, a strict diet is key. I eat the same grub every day - big helpings of beans/legumes, boiled veggies, and hefty salads. You gotta figure out your own triggers, though. Try to suss out the root cause of your psoriasis. Start by checking out your general health, diet, weight, smoking and drinking habits, stress levels, history of strep throat, vitamin D levels, use of IUDs, itchiness of psoriasis, past antibiotic use, potential candida overgrowth, presence of H. pylori, gut health, bowel movements, sleep patterns, exercise habits, mental health meds, potential zinc or iron deficiency, mold toxicity, digestive problems, heavy metal exposure, and magnesium deficiency. Keep a daily diary using an Excel spreadsheet to track your diet and inflammation. Think of psoriasis as a warning light on your car's dashboard. With psoriasis, you gotta get all the details right.

Again, went to the gp and he said I might have Marfan syndrome(as I am 6\"3 and weigh 55kg)I got all the tests done and came back clear. So he prescribed me naproxen and a weeks worth of diazepam which really helped. Me and the doctor still do not know why that happened but it is happened twice in the last year lasting around a week each time. Now at the end of 2023 the pain was unbearable and I have had numerous blood tests to check for the rheumatoid markers which all came back clear. It was not until I went to the same doctor about a psoriasis flare up did he say it might me psychotic arthritis! Because both me and him did not know I had it( I just thought it was dry skin and dandruff lmao) So I got put on the waiting list in early December to see a rheumatologist, to my surprise I got a call today saying I have an appointment tomorrow!! And I know people normally wait months or even years on the wating list. I am kinda nervous about the appointment and do not know what to expect? So any info or tips would be greatly appreciated!

They changed my dogs heart medication and the heart vet said she thought she had another 1.5 year to live. That same week the new diuretic was causing harm to her kidneys. She shutdown so quick, we had 3 coughing bouts for one month before this which I took her to the vet for - she was struggling that month but would bounce back after the vet visits. During the same week I was so excited to have more time with her then we had to make the decision to let her go to doggy heaven by the end of the week when the new diuretics that helped her cough was shutting down her kidneys. She had syncope and collapse twice that week. We knew it was time. We had been managing her heart probs for the last two years. Her cough started in July 2022 and she passed in Nov 2022. But then on the other hand I will read about dogs barely on meds and managing and have had a cough for TWO years+ I hope you get more time with your doggo The vet had me count her breaths as well.","disease":"congestive heart failure","classification":"Heart Disease"}]},

I would recommend an apple cider vinegar rinse to restore your scalp's pH levels, soothe the itchiness, and cleanse any build-up. A few tablespoons of ACV in a cup of water would be enough for your length of hair. Let it sit for 3-5 minutes, then thoroughly rinse your hair with warm water. The vinegar smell will not stay in your hair, no worries. After that, I would suggest figuring out your hair's porosity and finding an oil that fits it. The test is simple, just collect a couple strands of your hair from a brush or comb (or pull them if you are into that) and place them on the surface of a glass of water for five minutes. Stays on the surface: low-porosity Drifts in the middle: medium-porosity Sinks to the bottom: high-porosity I have over 3' long low-porosity hair and it thrives on jojoba, argan, almond, or apricot seed oils. Most shampoos, conditioners, and masks contain avocado, coconut, castor, or olive oils which are not compatible with low-porosity hair and will make it feel drier, even crispy all the while weighing it down and dulling it.

But then I slowly started to recover, and slowly was able to work more. I eventually got to the point where I thought I would be fine to go back to work. I was not, and after a year of trying to force myself to keep going I finally collapsed. Spent a month on the couch barely able to move because the stress had screwed my body up so much. Took me over a year to recover. Decided I could work again. Got a full time job again. Thought I was good until the cracks started to show again. Thankfully I was in therapy and instead of continuing to push myself I instead asked to switch to part time and they said yes. So now I work three days a week. On those three days, that is all I do. On the other four days, I recover and if I feel up to it, I do more. I can tell that I would gotten myself into burnout again and right now I am still healing. Give yourself some grace and love. You deserve it. You did not ask for any of this. You do what you can and let the rest go, even if what you can feels small - it is not small, though. Healing is a lot of work, and maintaining space to do that healing in the face of a culture that wants to grind you into dust is even harder. You are not alone.

Unfortunately, yeast is in so many things that taste good that it is easier to list what it is not in than what it is.

However it started getting to the point where my knees were locking up and I was having difficulty walking. My dermatologist had suggested a referral to a rheum just in case, since he mentioned with psoriasis there often can be internal inflammation as well. My primary care doc made the referral after a blood test confirmed I had elevated CRP levels, and after 8 or 9 months of waiting I got my first appointment! Within 5 minutes the rheum diagnosed me with PsA, based on the joint swelling and pain and how it presented (asymmetric vs symmetric, so it was PsA and not RA). Was able to start on biologics and have not worried about being in a wheelchair since, though I deal with plenty of other issues from the PsA which unfortunately the medication does not completely manage.

Even the scented variant of FC is weakly scented to be gentler to the skin/freshwater life, so you will feel that scent dissipates really fast compared to OS. I just recommend the unscented variant which is fragrance free esp if you are experiencing skin problems as some are sensitive to fragrance elements. Anyway, do not use anything for a while until this rash/burn goes away. In the meantime you could try putting on penthanol (viramin B5) cream for burns/rashes to help yourself.

Each wart and fungus started out really mild, and stayed that way for years, possibly decades, before it was severe enough to diagnose. My fingers were so mild that they did not care. But I cared. The skin around my fingers was always sore and hurt, and my nails were so thin they would just crumble away. And I was over it. I have access to the same websites doctors use for treating warts and fungus, so I used that. I tried everything under the sun for the warts, and finally succeeded with apple cider vinegar. As for the fungus, it said the only effective over the counter treatment was: **propylene glycol, urea and lactic acid**. I googled that and found a drug called Emtrix. I also have seen many users in this forum have amazing success with **Vicks Vapor Rub**, so I used that as well and definitely recommend! Just remember, it takes 6 months for a completely new finger nail to grow out. So you must treat it for at least that long to prevent recurrence. The treatments killed the fungus and made my nails so weak and brittle at first, but they are growing out healthy new nail.","disease":"nail fungus and warts","classification":"Other"}],"negative_verbatim":[{"nn_verbatim":"My history is diagnosed Graves' disease > radioactive iodine> hashimotos, celiac disease, dysmenorrhea, arthritis.

I was alone in the room with her the first time it happened so I stayed and comforted her through the first one and then got the nurse who said it was part of agonal respiration and gave more morphine. The second time it happened, there was a priest in the room giving last rights who excused himself to get the nurse, who again, came in with more morphine. Again, I stayed right there with her telling her it was ok. My mom passed pretty soon after without any further incident. My question is, is this part of agonal respiration?

After a massive amount of blood panels, my inflammation markers were through the roof, but none showed that I have an actual autoimmune disorder or any other issues. It was just a reaction to the medication. Unfortunately, in my situation, my clinic did not believe me. For three weeks, they gaslit me into believing that I had anxiety and started me on stims anyway. After the second round of stims shots, and my health deteriorating, my body broke out in large hives. I was so happy to see something obvious that I could show to a doctor, and that is when I got my steroid shot. I will not be able to do IVF in the future. It took me about 2.5 months to start to feel normal again.

My RE has basically black listed me and will not return messages. it is unfortunate, and I carry a lot of psychological trauma from this whole event.

Regarding my story, nothing crazy.I had symptoms since childhood, undiagnosed (or rather misdiagnosed as anxiety, IBS, panic disorder.), then was successively diagnosed with endometriosis, psoriasis, but my remaining symptoms were not explained. I was then diagnosed with hEDS, the geneticist told me I probably had MCAS as well. Which was the remaining part of the puzzle. I was still untreated (at 30yo and suffering MCAS issues since childhood) flared up massively since the covid-19 mRNA vaccines, and other life events. I went to see a cardiologist for a POTS evaluation and she ended up diagnosing me with ME/CFS after a 2-day CPET. She expected me to \"crash\" and get PEM after the initial test (a tilt table test) but I did not. So she made me pass a 2-day CPET, which triggered a massive flare-up. I became bedbound, but now in hindsight I realise I was not bedbound from fatigue per se, but from MCAS flare-up. After the 2-day CPET I had massive dizziness, could not stand due to low BP and had tongue and throat swelling. This is what made the doctor diagnose me with ME/CFS. But I actually do not experience PEM on a daily basis, apart with cardio exercise which is actually also a big trigger if you have MCAS. I do not get worse by speaking too much, or using my brain too much etc which is sadly a very common pattern in ME/CFS.

I have been lingering around here since I stopped drinking on Jan 1st and figured I would share a bit of my experience. I have been a binge drinker since my early 20s, 3-4 times a week, my longest sober streak was my pregnancy in 2021-22. I am 37. A year and a half into my son's life I decided I want him to always have the best version of me, and to be honest I really started to feel like my health was failing. Upset stomachs all the time, exhausted all the time but sleeping like garbage or just flat could not sleep, I have psoriasis on my hands (still do sadly) Improvements have been slow and steady. I can finally eat most anything and have normal poops haha. That actually took almost 60 days to get better. I sleep better. And I am just so much more present in my life. I am finally not obsessing over drinking. It still crosses my mind of course, but that whole woe is me I will never drink again and the intense cravings nonsense is essentially gone. Which I am glad for, that was honestly the hardest for me. My skin looks fucking amazing. I swear I have aged backwards. it is so cool. No weight loss here because I allow my self to indulge. But no gain either. I honestly could stand to lose maybe 5lbs, I am not a big girl only 130. Plus I would literally starve myself previously just so I could drink I started this journey planning to see how I felt in 60 days. Kept going because I felt I needed more time. Now after passing 90 I am committing to a life time of not drinking today. If you are new to this journey, the cravings DO get better. I promise. You have fun again.

From what I have read about Omnilux, it puts out red, near-infrared, and blue light, and they state these in a single wavelength for each. Infrared light includes wavelengths that are just beyond out ability to see on the red end of the spectrum (lower frequency, longer wavelengths), while ultraviolet light is beyond our ability to see on the violet/blue end of the spectrum (higher frequency, shorter wavelengths). Infrared is lower frequency than visible light, and far-infrared is what we feel as warmth. Ultraviolet is higher frequency and is what is responsible for damaging our skin, as well as for sun sensitivity in people with lupus. Both the blue and red light output by the mask are in the visual spectrum. Some bulbs, incandescent light bulbs, for example, put out broad spectrum light, which includes a small amount of UV light. Individual LEDs generally do not, and the amount of UV they put out (if they are putting out any) is generally miniscule. Omnilux states that their masks do not emit UV (though I would try to verify this if I were using the mask).

I was diagnosed w/ hypothyroidism in 2013, then again after a PCP said I did not have it. I changed PCPs and was later re-diagnosed. Have been on 75 mic of Levo since. Labs are good. Last year, I developed what I thought was Achilles tendinitis in the R ankle. Went to a podiatrist who recommended the usual protocol - RICE and PT. None of it worked and the pain spread to the inner and outer ankle w/ a burning sensation. The doc and I decided to try PRP which has shown good results but insurance does not cover. It did not work, and I did not show symptoms of other injuries/disorders of the ankle. We had a discussion about pain now developing in the left ankle, symmetrical pains that now developed in the outside of the wrists and my family autoimmune history. He sent me for ANA screen (positive) w/ titer (1:80), RA factor (<14), CCP (<16). Made an appt w/ a rheumatologist who said people over 60 do not get lupus but was interested in the family history. He sent me for CMP (unremarkable), RA factor (again <14), Anachoice screen w/refl to titer, ifa (this time negative), DNA ab (ds), AM antibody/ SJOGREN'S antibody/SCL-70 antibody/SM/RNP antibody (all negative). C3/C4 were WNL and CCP was <16 again. The rheum said there was no connective tissue disease and no follow up is indicated. In the meantime, the ankle pain subsided but the wrists became more painful. Now the ankles have become more painful and I am hobbling around. Can anyone make sense out of this? I have an appt w/ the PCP on Monday to discuss imaging.

I joined a local support group seeking comfort, but instead I feel more anxious about my future with lupus.

A lady replied to me saying \"your face will change and you will be fat, you just have to accept it\". do not get me wrong, my health is more important than how I look but I do care about how I look, not just for vanity, but because feeling good about myself boosts my overall well-being. I would love to join the gym and I have always wanted to get into weightlifting but now it feels as if that is something impossible. Aside from that, reading about others experience with this disease is truly terrifying. I have been given the warning to \"get ready to grieve my old life,\" and it has intensified my fears. With my lupus activity currently mild and fatigue as my main symptom, the uncertainty of the disease's progression scares me. I am afraid of only having a few good years as it can hit you out of nowhere. Is it bad for people with lupus to weight lift or strength exercise with goals to build muscle?

On the second day a transplant nurse told me I was unlikely to be listed because I was too healthy, especially considering my VO2 max. I suddenly felt like a fraud.

So he felt the VO2 max was not dispositive and he made sure that I went on the waiting list.

Your expert cardiology team feels you should be evaluated, so I hope you can take comfort that it is warranted. Still, it is undoubtedly wise to be prepared for a \"no,\" as you obviously are.

I have an autoimmune disease and have been on biologics for years. Sometimes my ANA is positive, sometimes it is negative. I have had significantly worsening neuropathy over the years, graduating from small fiber neuropathy only to now also having large fiber neuropathy confirmed with nerve conduction testing. I have notalgia parasthetica from nerve damage, and brachioradial pruritis. If something can be done of course I want to do it. The neuropathy is so bad now that I have fallen down stairs and fallen at work. I am hoping this can improve or at least the progression can stop. (Have tried gabapentin and lyrica which help but I cannot tolerate them, unfortunately) Thanks in advance for any thoughts!","disease":"neuropathy","classification":"Other"}]},
